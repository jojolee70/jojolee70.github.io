        <h2>Condor Light</h2>
   
        <p>
            Created in 2010 by <a href="https://fontbureau.typenetwork.com/news/article/how-condor-sans-sational">David Jonathan Ross</a>, Condor is a typeface that cleverly plays on thick and thin weighted slabs while including the classy detail of <a href="https://blog.webtype.com/?p=5425">flattened curves</a>.  This typeface is typically used on landmarks or in architectural settings; however,for me it is much more classy than given credit for.  It offers strong fashion ties with companies like <a href="https://www.armaniexchange.com/us?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlJqWrcay5AIVIP_jBx0KUwlOEAAYASAAEgJoQvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&tp=126368">Armani</a> and Bloomingdale’s.  Condor Light is a string typeface that does just enough to get your attention, but won’t beg for it- like that pretty girl in  high school hallways on movies like Mean Girls. Yes, I did just refer to Condor Light as Regina George at least before Cady Heron and the whole bus situation. </p>
